     <h1>
      Cases
    </h1>
    <h2>
      What kind of output can I expect from an Advance pro-bono Pro Bono case?
    </h2>
    <p>
    Advance pro-bono projects are designed to significantly impact our client organizations, specifically around issues of strategy and organizational assessment. Projects typically create a series of presentations that communicate insights and recommendations to the organization. Many Advance pro-bono cases involve surveys to key stakeholders and constituents and these results are shared throughout the duration of the project. As a result, the final presentation should be a summary of the recommended courses of action that have emerged throughout the project.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What is the difference between working with Advance pro-bono and one of its sponsoring firms?
    </h2>
    <p>
    As a completely volunteer-run organization of junior consultants, Advance pro-bono takes on much smaller projects than the pro bono work of our sponsoring firms. Advance pro-bonoâ€™s clients tend to either be smaller, younger non-profit organizations or are smaller projects within a larger organization.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How long are Advance pro-bono cases?
    </h2>
    <p>
    Typical Advance pro-bono cases run approximately 3-4 months, although timing is flexible and Advance pro-bono case teams often extend or shorten timelines, depending on the particular project.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How much do Advance pro-bono cases cost?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Advance pro-bono charges a nominal fee to cover transportation, printing, and other small case team expenses. Since the success of Advance pro-bono cases is driven by the commitment and collaboration by the client, these minimal costs are also used to establish a sense of client investment. Advance pro-bono is sensitive to the financial situations of nonprofit organizations and is open to negotiating fees.
